# Recommended Hardware
Besides the 3D printer fillament (preferably PETG or ABS) some additional hardware is required to build a Joulesbox:

## The Box
The outside frame that will contain the battery cells.
### Required
- 12 AWG (or bigger) wire (the flexible kind with a silicone outer sheath)
- A DB15 female connector (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pc-Accessories-Connectors-Connector-20-Pack/dp/B014W0UQOS))
- An XT90E-M connector (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/FLY-RC-Gold-Plated-Protective-Accessories/dp/B0B1MDQSYF))
- M3 brass inserts (L: ~5mm, OD: ~4.5mm) (x4) (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/M3x5-0mm-OD4-6mm-Staking-Threaded-Quik-Tek/dp/B08TRK72TR))
- M3 flathead bolts (25mm x4, 10mm x 2)

### Technically Optional (but recommended): Fuse
- Mini ANL Fuse (Amperage depends on your battery cells & intended use) (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Pieces-Automotive-Marine-Electronic-System/dp/B09FK2KZPB))
- Copper ring terminals (battery lugs) for 12 AWG wire (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Battery-Terminal-Connectors-Terminals-HOUSUN/dp/B09BPSDB4Y))
- M5 nut / 5mm bolt; brass is recommended (x2)

### Optional (but good for peace of mind)
Optionally the rails of the pack can be clamped together.
- M2 bolts (x2)
- M2 Nuts (x2)

## The Battery Cell Holder 
The battery holders which will be contained in the box. Depending on construction method (spot-welded vs. non-welded) different hardware is required
### Holder
- 100mm / 4' (2.5mmx2.5mm head) zipties (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/AmazonBasics-Multi-Purpose-Cable-Ties-200-Piece/dp/B087MKMSDY))

### Non-spotwelded Construction
- 5mm wide braided copper wire (tinned preferred) (for instance from: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Sleeves-Expandable-Resistance-Protection-Shielding/dp/B0B14S3ST6))

### Spotwelded Construction
If you're going this route you probably already know what you'll need.
