# joulesbox
Power your machines with this simple DIY battery pack system.

## Required Materials
To build a box you'll need some stuff:
### Tools
- 3D Printer (with a big enough bed to print the box laying flat) 
- Soldering iron (12 AWG or bigger wire is used, so decent wattage & big tips)
### Materials
- All the things used in the different parts of the box can be found [here](docs/BOM.md)

## Standard Boxes
You can find some pre-generated boxes [here](prebuilt) for some common pack sizes

## Custom Boxes
To create a custom sized box you will need [FreeCAD](http://www.freecad.org) (or even better, the [realthunder version](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases)) and the files located [here](src). A quick guide to parametric joulesboxes can be found [here](docs/parametric_guide.md).
