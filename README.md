# joulesbox
Power your machines with this simple DIY battery pack system.

## Required Materials
Building a box will require some tools and hardware:
### Tools
- 3D Printer (with a sufficiently large bed to print the box laying flat) 
- Soldering iron (12 AWG or bigger wire is used, so decent wattage & big tips)
### Materials
- Material used in the various parts of the box can be found [here](docs/BOM.md)

## Standard Boxes
You can find some pregenerated boxes [here](prebuilt) for various pack sizes

## Custom Boxes
To create a box of custom size, you will need [FreeCAD](http://www.freecad.org) (or even better, the [realthunder version](https://github.com/realthunder/FreeCAD/releases)) and the files located [here](src). A quick guide to parametric joulesboxes can be found [here](docs/parametric_guide.md).
